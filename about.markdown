Hello! My name is Robbie DelPrete, I am a software engineer / technologist, electronic musician and avid skier from Rhode Island. I currently reside in Denver, Colorado.

I use this space to blog about novel things that I think could hopefully help others if they happen to stumble in :)

## Professional Work

Over the last 7 years I have been an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) and DevOps Engineer at Trip Advisor, Lola.com and VMware. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at Twilio-Sendgrid working on Cloud Native Developer Productivity and Developer Experience.

## Music

I write and perform electronic music under the pseudonym [Dark City Agent](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4N4DEuD0sL42yshtZFWGcw)

## Kaptive Audio

I am the co-founder of a music technology company called [Kaptive Audio](https://www.kaptiveaudio.com). To date we have released a free drum kit called jules tools. It is a [Kontakt Virtual Drum Kit](https://www.kaptiveaudio.com/jules-tools/) and we are very proud of how it came out!
